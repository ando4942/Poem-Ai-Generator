# AI Haiku Poem Generator

This project is an AI-powered Haiku poem generator that utilizes OpenAI's API to create Haiku poems and is deployed as a backend API using FastAPI, AWS CDK, Lambda, and API Gateway. The architecture includes OpenAI API for generating poems, FastAPI for handling HTTP requests, AWS CDK for infrastructure as code, AWS Lambda for serverless execution, and API Gateway for providing a RESTful endpoint.

As a backend-only project, there is no frontend interface provided; it is designed to be consumed by other applications or services. This means that you can integrate it with your existing frontend, mobile app, or any other platform that can make HTTP requests.
